# Twitter
Register, login, tweet, show home, search by user and tweet, follow, and unfollow with a CLI-based imitation of the most simple twitter functionalities.

## Usage
The app uses a CLI which means you will be able to call the runner file with a simple `python3 runner.py` command, followed by a positional `register` or `login` command.
After each of these commands there are positional `--username` and `--password` arguments, followed by positional and optional arguments depending on the command before this.
You can use `--help` to view these arguments.

## Run
This app currently uses a database engine that is embedded in default python packages, and does not need any installation prior to running.
